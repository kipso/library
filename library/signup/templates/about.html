<p class="lead">The objective of the Library Management Software is to handle the entire activity of a library. The software keeps track of all the information about the books in the library, their cost, their complete details and total number of books available in the Library. The user will find it easy in this automated system rather than using the manual writing system. The system contains a database where all the information will be stored safely. The system is user-friendly and error free.</p>
